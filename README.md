Get to Da Wataaa!
=================

### Start the game
Open the index file in your preferred browser.

### Objective
The bugs guard the path with great diligence. Evade the bugs, and get to the water.
Earn a high score to impress your friends, family, employers, co-workers, neighbors,
significant others, and potential significant others. Get a tattoo of your score
, and the date on which you earned it, to further earn street cred (though
please note that street cred does not operate on a similar point system).

### How to Play
Use the arrow keys to move your player character around the board.
If you're hit by a bug, you lose a point, and your character will be reset to
the beginning.
Dodge the bugs, and get to the water.
If you get to the water, you earn a point.
You know the rules, now get to da wataaa!
